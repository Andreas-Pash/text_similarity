# text_similarity analysis
This repository contains an implementation of text similarity measurement using semantic analysis techniques.
The primary goal is to compute how closely related or similar two text documents, sentences, or phrases are, based on their meaning rather than just syntactic similarity (word matching).

Key Features:

-Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

-Vectorization: Uses embeddings such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec to represent the text as vectors in high-dimensional space.

-Similarity Metrics: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Jaccard similarity, and others.

-Deep Learning Models: Integrates deep learning models like Sentence Transformers for enhanced semantic understanding.
