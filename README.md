# text_similarity
This repository contains an implementation of text similarity measurement using semantic analysis techniques.

 The primary goal is to compute how closely related or similar two text documents, sentences, or phrases are, based on their meaning rather than just syntactic similarity (word matching).  Key Features Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization. Vectorization: Uses embeddings such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT to represent the text as vectors in high-dimensional space. Similarity Metrics: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Jaccard similarity, and others. Deep Learning Models: Optionally integrates deep learning models like BERT or Sentence Transformers for enhanced semantic understanding.
